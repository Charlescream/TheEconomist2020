IT IS NO surprise that negotiations on Britain’s future relationship with the EU have been difficult. The two sides have dug into opposing positions on such issues as a level playing-field for competition, fisheries and the role of the European Court of Justice. Negotiating on politically contentious matters by video link, thanks to covid-19, makes it much harder to feel out necessary compromises. And the clock is ticking: the deadline for a deal is December 31st, when the transition period is due to end.
Next week sees the final round of talks before a summit in June due to assess progress. The previous one ended in a bad-tempered exchange of letters between the British negotiator, David Frost, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier. Mr Frost called for the EU to think again about its proposals. Mr Barnier said success was possible only if tangible and parallel progress was made in all areas. Both sides have published opposing draft treaties. Since each is under a mandate that can be changed only by their political masters, who are preoccupied by covid-19, expectations of any progress next week are low.

This is compounded by mistrust over implementing the withdrawal agreement, especially the protocol that keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union. Next week also sees the second meeting of the joint committee supervising this agreement. The EU is pleased that Britain has belatedly accepted that there will be border and customs checks between Northern Ireland and the British mainland. But it frets that not enough preparations have been made, especially against the risk that the negotiations may end without any trade deal in place.
For this is now a genuine prospect. Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, says it is even possible that the June summit may decide to abandon the negotiations, though Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, suggests the crunch is more likely to be in the autumn. A recent poll by the UK in a Changing Europe (UKinaCE), an academic think-tank, found that over 70% of its Brexit analysts believe a trade deal is unlikely to be agreed by the end of the year.
Such a gloomy prognosis is triggering renewed debate about the year-end deadline. The withdrawal treaty provides that, before the end of June, it can be extended by up to two years by agreement. But Boris Johnson is viscerally opposed to an extension. He has even made clear that he would veto any EU request for more time. Why such stubbornness, given that he also claims to want a deal?
One answer is that he and his team associate talk of extending deadlines with Theresa May’s weak government. They also maintain that an extension would betray those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for the Tories last December. This is hard to swallow, since Brexit formally happened in January and most voters seem to back an extension. An opinion poll by Best for Britain, a lobby group, found that two-thirds of respondents supported the idea, with almost half of those who voted Leave in 2016 also being in favour.
The government also thinks a tight deadline and tough bargaining increases pressure on Brussels to offer concessions. Mr Johnson harks back to last October, when he won changes to Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement that the EU had insisted could not be reopened. Yet what actually happened was that he accepted the EU’s original preferred option for averting a hard border in Ireland, which was to keep Northern Ireland alone in a customs union, implying controls in the Irish Sea.
A darker explanation is that Downing Street thinks the massive impact of covid-19 will swamp any adverse effects from leaving without a trade deal. Some ministers think covid-19 may now make a complete break with the EU easier to sell politically, especially if the blame can be placed on an intransigent Brussels. Yet the damage from reverting to World Trade Organisation terms would be large and enduring. A new study by the UKinaCE team reckons that, compared with the status quo, it would lower GDP by 8.1% after ten years.
To avoid this, an extension could be made more palatable. One possibility would be to go for less than a year, and insist that even this would be used only if a deal cannot be done sooner. Another idea, proposed by Raoul Ruparel, a former European adviser to Mrs May, is to agree to an extension only to sort out the practical implementation of a deal that still has to be reached in broad outline by December. Anand Menon, UKinaCE’s director, says an extension is needed even in the event of no deal, because covid-19 has left businesses on both sides ill-prepared for the disruption this could create.
An alternative is to ignore the end-June deadline for an extension and leave it to the autumn to decide. After all, Mrs May’s various extensions of the Article 50 Brexit deadlines were all done at the last minute. Yet there is a big legal problem. The withdrawal treaty was drawn up under Article 50. If its end-June deadline is not met, Article 50 can no longer be used because Britain is a third country. That means any extension in the autumn would have to go through a separate treaty. Worse, such a treaty might have to be ratified by national and, in some cases, regional parliaments.
In short, the risk of ending the year without a trade deal with the EU and with no extension of the deadline looks uncomfortably high. And, after months when covid-19 wholly usurped the agenda, Brexit is back to the fore.■
