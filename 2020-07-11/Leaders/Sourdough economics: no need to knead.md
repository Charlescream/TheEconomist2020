FUTURE ARCHAEOLOGISTS of the internet will unearth a fascinating shift in digital content in early 2020. Before this turning-point, social media were cluttered with videos of cats doing cute things. Now they are dominated by pictures of sourdough loaves doing nothing.
This transformation is one of the ripple effects of covid-19. When the pandemic locked people into their homes, they had a surplus of their own time and a dearth of others’ labour, so domestic life reverted to pre-capitalist self-sufficiency, and professionals turned their hands to whatever was needed. Deprived of fresh bread, bankers took up baking. When their shelves fell down, consultants tried a bit of carpentry. Faced with partners who began to look like yetis, barristers became barbers.

The experience of working with their hands has been, for many, revelatory. Kneading dough is more fun than manipulating figures. Erecting shelves is more satisfying than propping up failing companies. Snipping hair is more enjoyable than cutting budgets. Liberated from their narrow professional niches, these knowledge workers have found satisfaction exploring new skills. Deprived by homeworking of the competitive arena that offices provide, they have discovered a new one: social media, where they show off their wonky cupboards and lumpy loaves.
Now that the economy is coming back to life, these fledgling bakers, carpenters and barbers may be tempted to nurture those skills. They should resist, for three reasons.
First, if the bankers judged their output with the cold objectivity they apply to their own work, they would see that, compared with a skilled baker’s loaves, their sourdough is as unpalatable as an ill-structured deal. There’s a logic to the division of labour: people who have spent a lifetime developing a skill are better at it than those who have turned their hand to it for a few hours during the longueurs of lockdown. What, after all, would a banker think of the work of a baker who dabbled in a bit of M&amp;A while the loaves were proofing?
Cool calculation would also reveal to professionals a second reason for hanging up their aprons: the cost of their product, when their labour is properly valued. If an average New York lawyer spent an hour lovingly stretching and folding the sourdough, his loaf would cost around $400. No bread is worth so much bread—certainly not his. A lawyer who argued that time thus spent was a benefit not a cost, since breadmaking had turned from work into pleasure, might persuade a jury of economists. But that argument would raise the third reason why professionals should abjure handiwork: for the sake of their friends and family.
The pleasure which professionals take in practising their new crafts may not be shared by those condemned to consume their output. No doubt their nearest and dearest will assure them that the density of the bread lends it gravitas and the tufts in the haircut originality; but such assurances should be taken as a measure not of the quality of the product but of love for the producer. These caring kith and kin deserve the best, and professionals who persist in making second-rate stuff for their own satisfaction are not providing it.
Bankers who want to be really good bakers can give up their day jobs and take it up full time, but as their loaves rise, so their incomes will fall. Which raises one of the great questions in life: cash or craft? Dough or dough?■
