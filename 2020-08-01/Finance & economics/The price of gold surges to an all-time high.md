ON JULY 29TH the price of gold surged to an all-time high, as the dollar fell to its lowest level against the euro in nearly two years. Yields on ten-year Treasuries have stayed low, on fears of a rocky economic recovery, even as expectations of inflation have risen. That has depressed real yields, making dollar assets less attractive and adding to goldâ€™s lustre.
