WORKING FROM a shady veranda overlooking a shimmering sea, with five-star restaurants and golf courses within easy reach: what better place could there be to while away the pandemic than Barbados?
Like most of its Caribbean neighbours, Barbados has been good at keeping covid-19 out. A single new case hits the headlines. But that does not mean the island has been unscathed. Normally tourism brings in more than half of its foreign earnings. Now, many tourists are banned and the economy is reeling. The tourism minister, Kerrie Symmonds, puts unemployment at close to 40%.

Cue the latest proposal of the prime minister, Mia Mottley. She intends to introduce a “Welcome Stamp” for visitors to “work remotely in paradise” for up to a year. The idea is that if holidays are not possible, then maybe the island can attract well-heeled office workers who no longer have to go to the office. A few new telecommuters could spend as much as a boatload of briefly alighting cruise-ship passengers. Other Caribbean islands are considering rival schemes; Bermuda has announced one.
It did not take a pandemic for some digital workers to consider moving to a beach. But before now, it was legally difficult. Getting a work permit or immigrant status meant weeks or months of form-filling. Workers had to pay Barbadian income taxes. The new procedure looks quick and easy by comparison. For a fee of $2,000 for one person, or $3,000 for a family, you can take your Zoom calls from a real pristine white sandy beach, instead of merely selecting it as a virtual background. You continue paying tax according to the rules of whichever country you came from.
There will be some checks on new arrivals. We do not want “the scum of the earth, but decent and upstanding types”, says Mr Symmonds. Applicants must have health insurance, and the main breadwinner must earn at least $50,000. But otherwise the gates are open. “We welcome all. Everyone,” says Ms Mottley. “All must breathe, in this world and in this country.”
